# The Handbook

Welcome to [Hedmad's](https://github.com/MrHedmad) Handbook of Nice and Practical Tips! ðŸŽ‰

This handbook aims to:
- Collect **useful** and **practical** day-to-day tips on how to conduct bioinformatics analyses;
- Set **standards** for [data formats](docs/data/data_formats.md), [workflows](docsproject_structure/using_make.md), [project structure](docs/project_structure/structuring_a_project.md) and [code](docs/code/README.md);
- Provide **practical guidelines** on how to follow [FAIR data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and [code](https://faircode.io/) principles.
- Serve as a discussion hub for all the above through GitHub's collaboration features.

The Handbook is not meant to be read top-to-bottom, but navigated to the topic that you are interested of the most. Use the sidebar index to quickly jump to what page you'd like to read.

## Contributing to the handbook

The handbook is a collaborative effort, and we welcome all contributions: from new pages, to edits, to typo fixes, to simple discussion. For more information, head on over to [the Handbook's GitHub repository](https://github.com/MrHedmad/Handbook).

## We are not alone in here...

This is not the first handbook of its kind, of course. Other very useful online resources are:
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html): The handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. Many handbook pages are written with it in mind.
