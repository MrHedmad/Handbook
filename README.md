Welcome to the CMA-Lab's Handbook of Nice and Practical Things ðŸ¥³

This is a collection of a series of documents aimed as a reference for routine tasks that are non-obvious. It sets standards for our workflows and lets us have a place to discuss work protocols and the way we do things.

The Handbook is not meant to be read top-to-bottom, but navigated to the topic that you are interested of the most.

For meta-protocols on how to write the handbook, and more information on how you can contribute, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
