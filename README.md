## Contributing
Thanks for thinking of contributing! The handbook is nothing without people using it and contributing to it. A fully-fledged contributing guide is available in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Head on over to learn how to contribute.

You **can** contribute. You need not be a bioinformatics expert, and we treasure everything from new chapters, pages and overhauls, to the tiniest typo fix and simple discussion.

## We are not alone in here...

This is not the first handbook of its kind, of course. Other very useful online resources are:
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html): The handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. Many handbook pages are written with it in mind.
