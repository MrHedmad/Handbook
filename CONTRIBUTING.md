## How to contribute
We welcome any and all contributions!

This might be your first time contributing to something on GitHub. Don't worry, it's simpler that it looks. You can follow one of the many - many - guides online, such as:
- [The basics of Git in 10 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) by freecodecamp.
- GitHub's own [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world), especially the section on [contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects);
- Try to contribute to [this project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) to actually do a first contribution and see how it's done.

We use [issues](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/Handbook/issues) to track changes and discuss topics. If you want something easy to start contributing, [search for the `good first issue` tag](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/Handbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

### Pre-commit
A pre-commit hook is available to regenerate the index files when you commit, so
you don't have to do it manually. Just follow these easy steps to set it up:
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and be sure that you can call the `python` and `pip` commands from the command line (i.e. that they are in your `PATH`);
- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install), usually just `pip install pre-commit` (i suggest installing it *outside* a virtual environment);
- `cd` into the repository root (where the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) file is;
- Run `pre-commit install`.
- You're done!

When you commit, pre-commit will run, and update the indexes as needed. If it needs to update some files, it will abort the commit (so you can inspect what it did). It is (usually) safe to run `git add . && !!` to add all changes and commit again - the pre-commit will run again, change no file, and allow you to commit the updated files.

More information [can be found in the pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage).

### Recognizing contributions
If you contributed to the handbook, you'll be credited at the bottom of the main [README.md](README.md) file. If you contributed but you're not included, [open an issue](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/Handbook/issues) - feel free to scold us.

If you want to contribute, you must follow [CMA-Lab's code of conduct](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## What to write in the handbook

This handbook does not want to be a copy-paste of other - probably better - guides on the internet. It is a place to store and iterate upon best practices, standardized processes and more, mainly aimed at the CMA-Lab members. A meta-science "guide" of sorts. For this reason, do not simply copy-and-paste things you find on the internet - link to them instead.

There is a general template for new pages. You can copy-paste it from [the page template file](TEMPLATE.md) and fill in the blanks.

## How to write the handbook

The handbook is made up of several **pages**. Each page has its own `.md` file.
Pages are stored in the `handbook/content/docs/` folder. Every subfolder in `docs/` is a **chapter**. Chapters group pages in the same topics. The side menu follows closely the structure of the directories in the handbook. The `_index.md` files are the pages shown when the folder (i.e. the chapter) itself is accessed. They contain the index of the specific folder, plus a description of the chapter. The `/handbook/content/_index.md` file is the landing page of the book.

Each page in the handbook **MUST** follow the structure in the [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) file in the root of the repository. This is needed to correctly build the pages with HUGO and regenerate the indexes (i.e. the `desc` field is not required by HUGO but required by the indexes).

### Markdown quickstart
The handbook is written in GitHub-flavoured Markdown:
- [Markdown basics for the non-believers](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Github's guide on its own markdown format](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-)

Note that Github's markdown is used everywhere - in `.md` files, in comments, issues, pull requests, etc...

Links are written as `[link text](link)`. Links to pages in the handbook must be given relative to the root of the website, which is `/docs/` for mort pages. So, a link could look like:

```
[click me!](/docs/project_structure/using_make.md)
```

HUGO and the theme handles making them point to the correct rendered pages.

In triple-backtick code blocks, remember to specify the language of your code block to allow for the correct syntax highlighting. See [this guide](https://github.com/jincheng9/markdown_supported_languages) to see a list of supported languages.

You can add code blocks in bullet points by indenting, like this:
````md
- This is a bullet point.

    ```markdown
    code goes here
    and here's another line
    ```
- This is the next bullet point.
````
This renders as:
- This is a bullet point.

    ```markdown
    code goes here
    and here's another line
    ```

- This is the next bullet point.

Remember that markdown is converted to HTML for rendering. So you can actually write most HTML code in markdown and it will be rendered correctly. This is essential when adding images or GIFs. Use `<img><\img>` tags to include your images. GitHub does not like large images in repositories, so upload them to some third-party host and add a link to the raw image for now.

HUGO supports *shortcodes* to use instead of large HTML chunks. The `book` theme that the Handbook uses supports a few of its own. From the [documentation for the theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book#shortcodes)


### Rule 1 - Keep it simple, stupid
If you are writing a page in the handbook, keep it simple and concise. Include links to external resources if possible but always describe why the link is there - remember that this is not a wiki.

Love bullet points and avoid long and boring sentences. Keep your language as accessible as possible. If a concept is hard but an explanation of it does not fit in the theme of the page, move it to its own page.

The fact that you need to KISS does not mean being unclear or imprecise for the sake of conciseness. The final aim of the handbook is to be useful - make it so.

Do **not** use or reuse acronyms without defining them first. Use them sparingly.

### Rule 2 - Remember where you are at
If you are drafting a brand-new page, include at the top of the page the status of the page with a meaningful shields.io badge:

- If the page is completed, or in general will require little further editing to be complete, use the ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-brightgreen) tag.
    ```markdown
    ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-brightgreen)
    ```
- If the page is an ongoing effort but it is still usable, use the ![Ongoing](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ongoing-orange) tag.
    ```markdown
    ![Ongoing](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ongoing-orange)
    ```
- If the page is a draft, and still requires a lot of work, or is unusable in general, use the ![Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-red) tag.
    ```markdown
    ![Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-red)
    ```

If you don't want draft pages to show up in the website at all, add the `draft: true` variable in the page's YAML header (see the [TEMPLATE](/TEMPLATE.md) file).

If you're drafting, a link to the relevant drafting issue(s) (if any) is also useful. Disclaimers on top of the page (within blocks) are also useful, like:

```
{{< hint danger >}}
HEADS UP: This page has problems. See Issue [#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for more information.
{{< /hint >}}
```

Possible `info` block levels are `info`, `warning` and `danger`.

### Rule 3 - Be opinionated
Do not worry about being opinionated. This is **the** place to have opinions. You know that a tool is better that another? Suggest its use. You think that a popular workflow sucks? Say so, and propose alternatives.

If you do not agree with something that is written in the handbook, [open an issue](https://github.com/MrHedmad/Handbook/issues) and say your take on it. This is how we grow and develop the handbook and as researchers.

### Rule 4 - There's only fun here
This handbook should be useful, correct and concise, but there is no need to be overly formal. Keep those for boring people and meetings.

You can, and should, use emojis (copy-paste them) and gifs when appropriate (which means basically anywhere you like).

## Make it so
Congratulations on reaching the end of the contributing guide! Have a piece of cake üç∞. Now go, write the handbook, and make it so.
